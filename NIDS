Introduction
This document outlines the steps taken to configure Suricata as a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) on Kali Linux. The purpose of this setup is to monitor network traffic and identify suspicious activities through alerts generated by custom rules.

Prerequisites
Kali Linux installed
Suricata installed
Basic understanding of command-line usage
Step 1: Configure Suricata
Open the Configuration File

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml
Set Up the Network Interface Ensure the af-packet section is configured with the correct network interface (e.g., eth0).

Enable EVE JSON Output In the outputs section, ensure the following is enabled:

yaml
Copy code
outputs:
  - eve-log:
      enabled: yes
      filetype: regular
      filename: eve.json
      types:
        - alert:
            severity: info
        - http:
        - dns:
Step 2: Create Custom Rules
Open the Rules File

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/suricata/rules/local.rules
Add Custom Rules Example rules:

plaintext
Copy code
alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:"Possible SYN flood detected"; flags:S; threshold:type both, track by_src, count 10, seconds 1; sid:1000001;)
alert http any any -> any any (msg:"HTTP traffic detected"; sid:1000002;)
Save and Exit Save the file and exit the editor.

Step 3: Restart Suricata
Update Suricata Rules

bash
Copy code
sudo suricata-update
Restart the Service

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart suricata
Check Status Verify Suricata is running:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl status suricata
Step 4: Generate Network Traffic
Use Nmap to Generate Traffic Run a SYN scan on a target IP:

bash
Copy code
sudo nmap -sS -p 1-1024 <target-ip>
Monitor Alerts Open another terminal and monitor Suricata alerts:

bash
Copy code
tail -f /var/log/suricata/eve.json
Conclusion
This setup successfully configures Suricata as a NIDS, enabling it to monitor network traffic and generate alerts based on custom rules. The testing conducted with Nmap demonstrates the functionality of Suricata in detecting potential threats.
